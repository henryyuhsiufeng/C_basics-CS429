# Why Y86? 
Better introduction to assembly level programming than the x86

# Y86 Processor State
There are 5 types of states in the Y86 architecture
1. Processor Registers: Quick access of 64-bit address location in the CPU.
2. Condition Flags: 1-bit flags set by arithmetic or logical operations.
3. Program Counter: Indicates the current address of instruction for the CPU.
4. Memory: Byte-addressable storage Array that follows a little-endian byte order.
5. Status code: Indicate the state of program execution
